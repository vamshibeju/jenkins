Using Awk
The awk commands can be used to replace the first N occurrences of the word with the replacement.
The commands will only replace if the word is a complete match.

In the examples below, I am replacing the first 27 occurrences of old with new

Using sub

awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if(x<27&&$i=="old"){x++;sub("old","new",$i)}}}1' file
This command loops through each field until it matches old, it checks the counter is below 27, increments and the substitutes the first match on the line. Then moves onto the next field/line and repeats.
