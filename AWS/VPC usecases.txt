VPC usecases

1)Create 2 instances in the same vpc and add the routes of the ip address in there routetables 
so that they can ping each other via private ip.
2)Create 2 instances one in private and other in public and for private dont attach the internet
gateway so that the instance in private subnet can access internet via instance in public 
or we can create a nat gatewat so that it can access the internet.


3)To connect one server in one vpc to another server in another vpc we need to create peer connection 
.
