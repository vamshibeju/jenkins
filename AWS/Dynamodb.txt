Data is stored in tables 
There are 2 keys partition key and sort key which are used to filter the data based on this.
primary key also called as partition key.

=>To fetch the data fastly from the dynamodb we add indexes other than primary keys 

=>A secondary index is a data structure that contains a subset of attributes from a table, along with an alternate key to support Query operations
=>You can retrieve data from the index using a Query, in much the same way as you 
use Query with a table. A table can have multiple secondary indexes,
 which give your applications access to many different query patterns.

=>Dynamodb supports 2 types of secondary indexes 
1)Global secondary index 
2)Local secondary index
