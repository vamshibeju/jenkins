Master
------
Computer or vm where Jenkins is installed 
Serves request and handles build tasks
Agent 
-----
Executes task which are directed by master
Executors 
---------
Performs operations on Jenkins master or agent 
Computational resource for running builds 
BEST Practices for Jenkins 
-----------------------------
1.	Running builds on Jenkins master is not advisable as it increases load on the master and has risk for high security vulnerabilities.
2.	It is advisable to use agents for running the builds as it decreases the load on the master 
3.	WHEN TO USE TWO PIPELINES
•	Use two Pipelines if you want them to be able to operate independently, such as when
one part runs much less frequently;
	Example One:
o	One Pipeline to build, test and stage the software
o	A second Pipeline that runs the release flow
	Example Two:
o	One Pipeline that runs the main build, test, stage and deployment steps
o	A second Pipeline that does infrequent maintenance tasks such as
re-indexing a database.
