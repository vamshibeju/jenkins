3 way merge vs 2 way merge 

whenever a commit has happened it compares the 2 files and will merge it but when 3 way merge happened 
it compares the 2 files that need to be commited and also checks with source file 

squash and merge 
----------------
In this all the single commits are combined to a single commit and that commit will be pushed
