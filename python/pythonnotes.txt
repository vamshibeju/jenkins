1)to convert dictionary to json use// to update the json file 
import json 
json.dump(d,filename,indent='')
d- it is the base value
filename- to store the base value to the outputvalue
indent - space after the bracket 

2)to convert json to dictionaty//to load a json file and use and convert to dictionary
import json 
json.load(filename)

3)file.seek(0)-- to move the cursor to the starting of the file

4)enumerate(a)  creates an enumerate object which yields pairs of indexes and items.
 Then we iterate through that object 
print out the item-index pairs in each iteration together with some other strings.
===>>In an enumerate the first value is index and the second is the value

5)The sleep  method of the built-in time module suspends 
the execution of the script for the given number of seconds. usage:import time time.sleep()

6)LIST
-- INSERT is used to modify the index value but it will not create a new list and we 
can change the value on the index value of the list with INSERT
-- POP is used to remove from the list -- list.pop()
--clear is used to completely remove from the list -- list.clear()
--index is used to get the value from the index -- list.index()
-- count is used to get the count of a value from the index -- list.count()
-- sort is used to sort the elements inside the list // sorted(list) it also sorts the list but create
a new array
-- join is used for the strings 
ex: sentence =''
     new_sentence= sentence.join(['hi','how'])

7)DICTIONARY
-- the keys of a dictionary should be immutable and in the dictionary it should be unique

8)TUPLE
-It has only 2 methods count and index

9)SET
-- It cannot take the duplicate values 
set={1,2,3}
methods for sets: 
difference()--- shows the difference b/w 2 sets x.difference(y)
discard() x.discard(value)
difference_update-- it removes the difference from the set
intersection()
issubset() - if x is inside y then x.subset(y) = true
issuperset() 
isdisjoint()
