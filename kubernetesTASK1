Question 1: Creating Single Container Pods



Create a pod with the name of kplabs-nginx. The pod should be launched from an image of  mykplabs/kubernetes:nginx .
 The name of the container should be mycontainer



Question 2: Multi-Container Pods



Create a Multi-Container POD with the name of kplabs-multi-container

There should be 3 containers as part of the pod. Name the first container as first-container, 
2nd container as second-containerand 3rd container as third-container

1st container should be launched from nginx image, second container should be launched from mykplabs/kubernetes:nginx image and
 third container from busybox image.

Connect to the first-container and run the following command:  apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools

Connect to the third-container and identify the ports in which processes are listening. Perform wget command on those ports 
and check if you can download the HTML page.



Question 3: Commands and Arguments



Create a pod with the name of kplabs-cmdargs. The pod should be launched from an image of busybox . The name of the container s
hould be cmdcontainer. Both the container image's CMD and ENTRYPOINT instruction should be overridden.

The container should start with sleep command and argument of 3600



Question 4: Exposing Ports for PODS



Create a pod with the name of kplabs-ports. The pod should be launched from an image of nginx. 
The name of the container should be nginx. Expose Port 80 for the POD.



Question 5: CLI Documentation



1. List down all the available fields and it's associated description that we can include in a POD Manifest.
Store data to pod.txt



2. List down all the fields & it's description that we can add under the metadata section under POD manifest. 
Store data to pod-manifest.txt



3. Matthew has realized that there is an option for tolerationSeconds under POD -> Spec -> Tolerations.
 Store the associated documentation for tolerationSeconds and store it under a file named tolerationSeconds.txt



Question 6: Arguments



Create a pod named kplabs-logging

The Pod should have a container running from the nginx image with the following arguments:



    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done


Once POD is created, connect to the POD and verify the contents of /var/log/1.log and /var/log/2.log



Question 7: POD Troubleshooting



1. Create a POD with the name kplabs-troubleshoot. Launch it from busybox image.

2. Once launch, verify if you can see pod in "Ready" state.

3. If it's not in ready state, find out what can be the reason.

4. Edit the POD manifest to make sure busybox pod is available for at-least next 10 minutes.



Question 8: API Primitives

1. Create a proxy connection via kubectl proxy --port 8080

2. Verify from browser if you are able to see the list all the Kubernetes API's.

3. Find the list of resources under the /api/v1

4. Find the list of all the PODS running within your Kubernetes environment,
